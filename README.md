Delivery Delay Analysis Using Power BI
This project analyzes online delivery performance using real order data. A Power BI dashboard was built to calculate delivery delays, visualize patterns across zones, time slots, and weather conditions, and identify the top delay-prone areas. The insights help improve logistics planning, reduce delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.
